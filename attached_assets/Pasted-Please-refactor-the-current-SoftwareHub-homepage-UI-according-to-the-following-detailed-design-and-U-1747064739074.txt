Please refactor the current SoftwareHub homepage UI according to the following detailed design and UX requirements:
1. General Design Style
•	Adopt a modern, minimalist design with a clean and user-friendly interface.
•	Use the primary color palette:
•	Deep Blue (#004080) for navbar and primary buttons.
•	Soft Yellow (#ffcc00) as accent/highlight color for active menu items and hover states.
•	Light background (#f9f9f9 or white) for main content areas.
•	Use easy-to-read sans-serif fonts such as "Segoe UI", "Roboto", or "Open Sans."
•	Use simple, clear icons from libraries like FontAwesome or Material Icons.
2. Header (Navigation Bar)
•	Fixed top navbar with:
•	Left-aligned logo (clickable, links to Home).
•	Main menu with three items: Home | Projects | Marketplace.
•	Right-aligned user icon with dropdown menu for account management (Profile, Logout).
•	Navbar should have subtle scroll effects (background color change or shadow).
3. Homepage Body Layout
•	Divide the body into clear card sections with consistent padding and spacing:
•	Categories: Display software categories with icons or representative images in a horizontal filter bar.
•	Latest Software: Show newest software in a grid layout with cards (image, name, description, rating, version, and download button).
•	Popular Software: Show most popular software similarly in a grid or list.
•	Each card should have a white background, 8px rounded corners, subtle shadow, and clear typography hierarchy (title bold and larger than description).
•	Include "View All" buttons below each section to navigate to full lists.
Display 6 software cards per row horizontally (6 columns).
•	Display 4 rows vertically on the page, making a total of 24 cards visible per page.
•	Implement pagination controls below the card grid to navigate between pages of software listings.
•	Pagination should be user-friendly with clear page numbers and next/previous buttons.
•	The grid layout must be fully responsive:
•	On smaller screens, reduce the number of columns appropriately (e.g., 2-3 columns on tablets, 1 column on mobile) while maintaining the 4-row vertical structure if possible.
•	Cards should maintain consistent size and spacing to fill the row evenly.

4. Filters & Search
•	Provide filters for OS platforms (All, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS) above software listings.
•	Include a search input with placeholder "Search software..." in the header.
•	Provide toggle buttons to switch between grid and list views.
5. Footer
•	Dark blue background (#004080) with white text.
•	Include site branding, navigation links (Home, Categories, Popular, Latest), and legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Contact Us).
•	Footer content arranged clearly and spaced evenly.
6. UX Considerations
•	Fast load times and prioritization of main content.
•	Clear, unobtrusive notifications for actions like downloads or errors.
•	Hover effects on buttons and interactive elements should be smooth and consistent.
•	Accessibility: ensure sufficient color contrast and readable font sizes.
7. Additional Notes
•	Use consistent spacing and alignment throughout the page.
•	Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
•	Implement appropriate alt text for images and icons.
