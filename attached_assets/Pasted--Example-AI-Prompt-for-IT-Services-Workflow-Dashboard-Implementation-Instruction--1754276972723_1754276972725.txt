   - Result: Quotation sent to Client, status updated

3. **Client reviews and accepts/rejects quotation**  
   - Endpoint: POST /quotations/{id}/response  
   - Data: accept/reject flag  
   - If accepted: trigger 50% deposit payment request

4. **Client makes 50% deposit payment**  
   - Endpoint: POST /payments  
   - Data: quotation ID, amount (50% of total)  
   - Result: Payment recorded, project status changes to In Progress

5. **Admin works on project**
