Given you have three user roles—**seller**, **buyer**, and **admin**—here’s a tailored test scenario plan for the CHAT functionality based on typical screens and interactions these roles might have. This plan assumes your chat supports 1:1 conversations among these roles and possibly group chats involving admin.

### 3. Common Cross-Role Tests

- [ ] All users authenticate with valid JWT before connecting to chat.
- [ ] Users cannot connect with invalid or expired tokens.
- [ ] Messages are saved in MongoDB with correct sender, receiver, timestamps.
- [ ] Presence (online/offline) status updates correctly across roles.
- [ ] Typing indicators reflect user activity properly.
- [ ] Message delivery is reliable and ordered.
- [ ] Offline users receive missed messages upon reconnect.
- [ ] Users cannot send empty or invalid messages.
- [ ] Users cannot send messages to users who blocked them.

### 4. Edge Cases & Error Handling

- [ ] User loses connection mid-chat and reconnects — chat resumes seamlessly.
- [ ] User tries to send message with invalid format → rejected with error.
- [ ] User tries to send message to a non-existent or deleted user → error.
- [ ] User tries to join group chat without permission → denied.
- [ ] Admin forcibly removes a user from group → user loses access immediately.

### 5. Notifications & UI Feedback

- [ ] When a new message arrives, the chat list updates with unread count.
- [ ] Push notifications (if implemented) arrive correctly when app is in background.
- [ ] Read receipts (if implemented) update correctly across users.
- [ ] Typing indicators and presence status update in real-time.
