## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The application follows a comprehensive microservices architecture, designed for scalability and maintainability.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI for a modern, component-based UI.
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for relational data.
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with session management.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration.
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for real-time features.

### Microservices
The application is composed of several independent services:
- **Main Application**: SoftwareHub web application (Port 5000) - includes integrated notification service.
- **Email Service**: Handles email sending with retry mechanisms (Port 3001).
- **Chat Service**: Manages real-time messaging with Socket.IO and Redis (Port 3002).
- **Notification Service**: Integrated into main application for development simplicity. Ready for FCM production deployment.
- **Worker Service**: Processes background jobs for emails, notifications, and analytics.

### Data Management
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (for main application data like users, software, projects, products, orders).
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB (for chat service data).
- **Caching/Queueing**: Redis (for real-time chat, message queues, and caching).

### System Design
- **Inter-service Communication**: Comprehensive microservices architecture using REST APIs, Redis message queues, and Socket.IO for real-time features.
- **Docker Orchestration**: Production-ready Docker Compose setup with 8 containerized services:
  - Main Application (API Gateway + Frontend) - Port 5000
  - PostgreSQL Database - Port 5432  
  - Redis Cache/Queue - Port 6379
  - MongoDB (Chat) - Port 27017
  - Email Microservice - Port 3001
  - Chat Microservice - Port 3002  
  - Notification Microservice - Port 3003
  - Worker Service (Background tasks)
  - Nginx Load Balancer - Port 80/443
  - Automated Backup Service
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Emphasizes a modern, component-based design using Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for a consistent and responsive user experience. The dashboard is organized with clear sections, visual themes, and role-based features.
- **Development Guidelines**: Focus on modern web application patterns, maximizing frontend functionality, minimizing backend complexity, using Drizzle ORM, implementing proper error handling and validation, and maintaining separation between client and server code.

### Key Features
- **Software Catalog and Downloads**: Core functionality for software distribution.
- **Project Management**: Tools for custom development projects, including quotation and collaboration.
- **Marketplace**: Functionality for buying and selling software products.
- **User Management**: Multi-role system (user, admin, developer, client, seller, buyer).
- **Real-time Communication**: Admin chat management and real-time messaging.
- **Notifications**: Push notification system for various user activities.

## External Dependencies

- **Stripe**: For payment processing and escrow functionality.
- **SendGrid**: For email sending services. **Status**: API key configured, sender verification required for cuongeurovnn@gmail.com.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time bi-directional communication (used in Chat Service).
- **Redis**: Used for caching, message queuing, and real-time chat data.
- **FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)**: For push notifications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy for Docker orchestration.
