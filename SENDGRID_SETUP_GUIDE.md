# SendGrid Setup Guide for Welcome Emails

## Current Issue
The registration system is working perfectly, but emails are failing with "403 Forbidden" error. This indicates:

1. **API Key Issues**: The API key may not have proper permissions
2. **Sender Verification**: The sender email address needs to be verified in SendGrid

## Required SendGrid Configuration

### 1. API Key Permissions
Your SendGrid API key needs **Mail Send** permissions:
- Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
- Create new API key with **"Full Access"** or **"Restricted Access"** with these scopes:
  - `mail.send` (required)
  - `mail.send.schedule` (optional)

### 2. Sender Authentication (Critical)
SendGrid requires sender verification. You need to:

**Option A: Domain Authentication (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/domain
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
3. Complete DNS verification
4. Use emails like `noreply@yourdomain.com`

**Option B: Single Sender Verification**
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
2. Add sender email (e.g., your personal email)
3. Verify via email confirmation
4. Use that exact email as sender

## Current Implementation
The system will:
- ✅ Create user accounts successfully
- ✅ Log them in automatically  
- ✅ Show success message on frontend
- ❌ Email sending fails due to SendGrid configuration

## Test Results
- Registration endpoint: **Working** ✅
- User account creation: **Working** ✅  
- Session management: **Working** ✅
- Email service integration: **Working** ✅
- SendGrid API call: **Failing** ❌ (403 Forbidden)

## Next Steps
1. Configure sender authentication in SendGrid
2. Update API key with proper permissions
3. Test email functionality again

The core welcome email feature is implemented and ready - it just needs proper SendGrid configuration to work.
